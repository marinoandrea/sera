# SeRà

To improve food and nutrition security in Mali, it is important that farmers and family farms in Mali have knowledge about, and access to quality seeds for cereal crops. Due to several limitations that some farmers have, the current system of buying and selling seeds still needs some improvements. Given that a few of these limitations are low literacy and a lack of internet access, we have come up with a project called SeRa. With SeRa we hope to support the current work of the AOPP by offering both farmers and OP’s the opportunity to use a voice-based interface. The key idea of this project is that SeRa offers a database in which all the product information will be stored. This database is connected to a voice server that can be used by both OP’s and farmers to either upload or retrieve information by phoning in. This adds value to the current work of AOPP, as it will be audio-based and therefore use of the internet or reading/writing skills will not be necessary.
